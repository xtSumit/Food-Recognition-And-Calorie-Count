## Problem Statement
To create a food recognition system which helps to keep track of everyday calorie intake based on food recognition and classification to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

## Objective
In this project we tackle the problem of recognizing a food item from an image and subsequently measuring the calorie intake from the image of the dishes being consumed. The Dataset is gathered from the local restraunts and cafeteria around my college campus wich are easily available to the students. The food items chosen to create the dataset are as follows idli, dosa, apple, banana, paneer tikka and palak paneer, all of which are Indian cuisine. This project finds application in the area of health analytics, where dieticians can recommend their patients the calorie intake, and the patients by using an app that can take the photo of the meal they consume and keep track of their calorie in take. Further the data of calorie intake can also be used to find the co-relation between the calorie consumption and the various health problems.
